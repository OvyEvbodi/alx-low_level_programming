### ALX structures and typedef project
<hr>
This directory contains C program fragments on user defined data stuctures. It also tasks that imply I have an in-depth understanding of creating user defined data types. The tasks include how to:

- Declare and define a structure in C
- Minimize padding using packing
- Optimize CPU cycles
- Manipulate structures using pointers
- Free up memory previously reserved for a structure
