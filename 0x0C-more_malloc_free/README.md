### malloc() and exit()

This project contains mini tasks that show my understanding of the malloc function, and how to use exit() to terminate my program, depending on the state of the flow within the program, and the available data. 
#### This project shows how to:
- Allocate memory using malloc
- Use exit() to return an exit code
- Use free() to release previously preserved memory
